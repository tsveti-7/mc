Monte Carlo Methods

A good example of a Markov process in physics is the process of movements of electrons in a gas. Each time an electron bumps into a molecule of the gas, an elastic or non-elastic scattering can occur, and the trajectory of the electron depends only on the present state and not on the past (Markov property).

The aim of this project is to simulate electron trajectories using Monte Carlo methods. 
A Fortran code has already been developed (https://github.com/pisov/mc) and we are aiming to do a working version in Python as well.
