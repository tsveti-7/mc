Monte Carlo Methods

A good example of a Markov process in physics is the process of movements of electrons in a gas. Each time an electron bumps into a molecule of the gas, there can happen an elastic or non-elastic collision.
The aim of this project is to simulate electron trajectories using Monte Carlo methods. 
We already have a Fortran code (https://github.com/pisov/mc) and we are developing a working version in Python as well.
